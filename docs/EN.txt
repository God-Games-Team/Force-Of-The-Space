We are a group of developers who have set out to make a game called * Force Of The Space *

The PreAlpha version of the game will be completely free, but alpha and above will be paid either directly or if you subscribe to [Patreon] (Addlinckhere.com)

Our team consists of four members, WaveLink, Lukosipo, Sajmonator and Bud1k. The work is evenly distributed between us, so we don't have our roles yet.

Communication is important to us, but since one of our members is not currently in the Republic

The project is still inactive, but as soon as we know what we will do, we will start working on it.

Our team is not finished yet, but we are not looking for new people either. If you want to support our project, but not financially, you can help us with a bit of work.
